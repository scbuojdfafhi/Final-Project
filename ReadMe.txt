There are 3 code files and 3 datasets.

CODE:
1. 'Final_project' is an ipynb file

2. 'LSTM_Model' runs in the Matlab R2022a.

3. 'CNN_Model' runs under tensorflow (Keras) environment.

Datasets:
1.'data_final' contains physiological data with emotion labels collected by 3 subjects.For traditional machine learning methods.

2. 'ECG_train' contains 72 instances of ECG signal data collected by Fitbit Sense, which is a training set for LSTM and CNN model.

3. 'ECG_test' contains 30 instances of ECG signal data collected by Fitbit Sense, which is a testing set for LSTM and CNN model. 

 In order to execute code smoothly, please change file path in the part of reading data.
